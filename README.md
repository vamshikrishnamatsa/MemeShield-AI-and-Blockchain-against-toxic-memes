# 🛡️ MemeShield: AI + Blockchain Powered Cyberbullying Detection in Memes



---

## 📌 Overview

**MemeShield** is an innovative AI-powered web application that detects **cyberbullying in memes** using advanced **multimodal analysis** (image + text). Leveraging **MoonDream**, **OCR**, and **blockchain (Ethereum + IPFS)**, the system not only identifies offensive memes but also stores detection results in a **tamper-proof and decentralized** way for transparency.

Memes today are often used to subtly spread harmful or derogatory content that bypasses traditional moderation tools. This project bridges the gap by analyzing both image and text content simultaneously and ensuring secure storage of detection data using blockchain technology.
